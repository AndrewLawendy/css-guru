# Motivation

I'm a front end engineer who was self taught through multiple online learning platform and I understand how challenging the code is for someone who has no prior knowledge of it.

My sister started her own path as well and sometimes she struggles with the frustration of writing code that doesn't do as expected for her, so I thought that I can build a tool that can help her translating her code into a human comprehensible language so she can easily spot the mistake in her logic.
