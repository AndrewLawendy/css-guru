## Motivation

I'm a front end engineer who was self taught through multiple online learning
platforms, and I understand how challenging the code is
for someone who has no prior knowledge of it.

My sister started her own path as well and sometimes she struggles
with the frustration of writing code that doesn't do as expected for her,
so I thought that I can build a tool that can help her translating her code
into a human comprehensible language so she can easily spot the mistake
in her logic, and I like to share this tool with the world.
